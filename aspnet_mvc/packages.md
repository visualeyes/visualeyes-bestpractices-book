# Packages
Packages are independent software components that can be used by other pieces of software. Creating packages reduces code duplication, coupling and increases cohesion of the application.

## Nuget

There are Nuget packages that provide Front-End Web components. However, NPM or Bower are better options for these components.

## NPM
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the package manager for [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). In the context of an ASP.NET project, NPM packages can provide Front-End components, JavaScript modules or tools.
