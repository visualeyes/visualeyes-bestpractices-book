# Architecture
The two prominent Architectures for Web Applications are **Monolithic** and **Service Oriented**.
 
## Monolithic Architecture
Monolithic architecture describes an Application that contains all the components in a single program on a single platform. Internally Monolithic Applications contain separate components.

**Example**

## Service Oriented Architecture (Microservices)
Service oriented Architecture or Microservices are provide services to other components. Each service is an independent system that make up a larger Application. For example, one service may provide the UI and another may provide data persistence through APIs.

Pros and Cons of Microservices are described in detail by [Martin Fowler in this post](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html)
